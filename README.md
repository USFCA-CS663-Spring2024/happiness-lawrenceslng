## Notes for Grader

The written answers to question 1 is interspersed between all the graphs. I have made attempts to make it as clear as possible which question I am answering, and it should be easy to follow the work and my thought processes on answering these questions. Answers 2 and 3 are more explicitly stated and work done to reach those answers are clearly shown as well.
